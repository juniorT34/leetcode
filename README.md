# LeetCode Journey

This repository documents my personal journey solving LeetCode problems. The goal is not to collect every solution, but to learn core data structures and algorithms and practice targeted problems until the concepts are comfortable.

## Learning Strategy

- **Learn by topic:** Pick a data structure or technique (for example, arrays & strings), study the common patterns and complexities, then solve problems that exercise those patterns.
- **Start simple → increase difficulty:** Begin with easy problems for a topic, then move to medium and hard as confidence grows.
- **Understand one pattern per session:** Focus on internalizing one pattern (e.g., two pointers, sliding window) rather than jumping between many patterns in the same day.
- **Write clear, testable code:** Keep functions small, add docstrings and examples, and add unit tests when possible.
- **Repeat and review:** Revisit solved problems after a few weeks to solidify retention.

## Topics I Practice

This repo follows a topic-driven progression. Typical topics I work through:

- Arrays & Strings
- Hashmaps & Sets
- Two Pointers
- Stacks & Queues
- Linked Lists
- Binary Search
- Sliding Window
- Trees
- Heaps / Priority Queues
- Recursive Backtracking
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

Each topic will contain solutions and notes that highlight common patterns, complexity analysis, and pitfalls.
